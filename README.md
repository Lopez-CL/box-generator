# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and implements full CRUD functionality in allowing a user to generate a box based on their input for interior color, width, and height. The user can create the color of their box, update it's color, and remove it from their collection of boxes. This poroject also uses UseState hooks.
